## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
- SASS/SCSS
  - BEM
- JavaScript
  - JQuery
  - JSON

### Difficulties

I was having a difficult time connecting the JSON file on GitHub. The connection between my JS file and the JSON file worked fine on my local machine via live server. However, the connection kept failing once the files were uploaded to GitHub.

On my local machine I used `../data.json` to locate the file from my JS file while on GitHub I had to use `./data.json`. I don't understand why.
